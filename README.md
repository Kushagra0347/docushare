## Frontend
- Run `npm i`
- then run `npm start`

## Backend
- run `pip install -r "requirements.txt"`
- run `python manage.py runserver` or `python3 manage.py runserver` or `py manage.py runserver` [it's the one that I use]
- then, run `py manage.py createsuperuser` to create a super user and access djando admin panel
- and tadaaaa 🍾, you have a working project

### PS: You have to keep running both the servers in order for the project to work
